# Date Planner
## A website that will generate fun date activities.


## Usage
This is a date idea generating website. It has inputs for your location, distance range, the number of ideas you want to generate, what kinds of ideas you want, and a simple price range. When you click the submit button, the website generates cards based on your input with useful ideas and activity information formatted on them. One last simple feature is that your location input is saved, and will be repopulated whenever you come back to the website. Simply input location, travel distance, number of date options displayed, activity catagory, price range, and submit!
